					<div class="faq"><h1><b>Q.Will my child be safe?</b></h1>
					<p>Boarding schools take your child's safety very seriously. Contractually a boarding school functions in loco parentis which is a legal way of stating that the school acts in the place of the parent when it comes to supervision of its students, your child included.</p></div></center><br><br>

				<div class="faq">
				  <h1><strong>Q.Will he have time to himself?</strong></h1>
				  <p>Yes. Of course. Part of the structured life in a boarding school is downtime. Everybody needs it. Time to sit and watch a movie. Time to throw a ball around. Or just read for fun. The only difference is that he will be under the watchful eye of adults.</p>

				<div class="faq">
				  <h1><strong>Q.Will he have enough money?</strong></h1>
				  <p>That depends. Certainly, he is going to be around some rather well-off classmates. Boarding school will open his eyes to all kinds of things about the way people live. It will also remind him from time to time that money is not the same as love. Put another way, boarding school students have parents who are too busy to spend quality time with them too. Make sure he has an allowance but also let him know your limits. </p>

				<div class="faq">
				  <h1><strong>Q. Will my child have to be tested before she goes to school on Opening Day?</strong></h1>
				  <p>It depends on the school because each private school determines its protocols. Generally, schools seem to be requiring a negative result on a polymerize chain reaction (PCR) test before school opens. Given all the news reports we have seen about how long it takes to get test results, i.e., 7 to 14 days, I recommend scheduling the test well in advance. Ask your school for guidance, and plan accordingly.</p>
