Here, we enlist some of the premier institutions that provide quality education to our masses.</p>

Today, we better off than we were millenniums ago? The one crucial element that truly made a difference, that helps create better societies, develops virtues and gives us a sense of freedom—is Education.</p>

							  <a href="#" ><center><img width="400" height="400" src="images/ministry.jpg" alt="" /></center></a>
							  <p>&nbsp;</p>
The Indian government replaced a 34-year-old National Policy on Education, framed in 1986, with the New Education Policy of 2020. The NEP, approved by the union cabinet, makes sweeping reforms in school and higher education including teaching. Some of the biggest highlights of the NEP 2020 are, 1) a single regulator for higher education institutions, 2) multiple entry and exit options in degree courses, 3) discontinuation of MPhil programmes, 4) low stakes board exams, 5) common entrance exams for universities.
